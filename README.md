# MEP Preprocessing â€” Streamlit GUI (dev branch)

**Branch:** `streamlit-gui-dev`
**Status:** *Developer preview (actively changing). Expect breaking changes.*

This branch contains a **GUI-driven pipeline** for preprocessing **motor evoked potentials (MEPs)** acquired with TMS. It wraps the established signal-processing steps from the main pipeline into an interactive **Streamlit** app that guides you from file selection to quality control and export.

---

This GUI is intended to replace the older step-by-step guide. The previous implementation remains available in `old_pipeline/` on the `main` branch for reference.
